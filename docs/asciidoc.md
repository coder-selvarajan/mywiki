## What is AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is two things:

- A mature, plain-text writing format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.

- A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called backends), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub.

AsciiDoc belongs to the family of lightweight markup languages, the most renowned of which is Markdown. AsciiDoc stands out from this group because it supports all the structural elements necessary for drafting articles, technical manuals, books, presentations and prose. In fact, it’s capable of meeting even the most advanced publishing requirements and technical semantics.

Serving as testament of this fact, many O’Reilly authors including Matthew McCullough, Tim Berglund, Simon St.Laurent, Matt Neuburg and Ian Darwin have used AsciiDoc to write their books for that iconic technical library.


From the very beginning, AsciiDoc was designed to be a shorthand replacement for DocBook, one of the formats AsciiDoc can generate. AsciiDoc can also produce beautiful HTML5, PDFs, eBooks, man pages and even slide decks. It has you covered from first draft to publishing.
