## Learning Strategies 

- Conceptual Vs Active Learning : 
    - Keep a balance between conceptualized learning and active learning. Conceptualized is about reading the book and watching the youtube videos.. Active learning is practicing what you have learnt.  
    As a beginner, keep the ratio of 2:1 - that is after every two hours of conceptual learning an hour of active learning should follow. Later you can keep a ratio of 2:2.
- Follow pomodoro technique
- Teaching and re-explaining concepts
- Document what you have learnt
- Avoid these three things
    - Perfection
    - Comparison
    - Complexity
- Rest & Relax
