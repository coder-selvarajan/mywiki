2. Do you prefer to read local news or international news?  
Well, I suppose that I prefer/have an inclination towards international news, especially news about relationships among countries around the world. This is probably because I really care about diplomatic issues and want to keep track of what's happening outside my country.

I'm not really sure about this, but I suppose that there will be fewer people reading magazines in the future.

Maybe in the future perhaps specialists will be the only ones who read the magazines which relate to their own particular fields

6. Do you think newspapers will be very important to you in the future?
