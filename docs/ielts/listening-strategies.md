---

- Read the rubric (titles, instructions, question types) carefully.
- Glance through the questions
- Underline/circle/star key words in the question
- Predict what you might hear,
- Listen carefully if words are spelt for you, as there are different ways of spelling words
- Recognise paraphrases and synonyms as these may be used in the question.
- Check answers after every task (30 sec. to check).
- If you miss an answer don't panic, move on.
- If you can't decide between two answers, write down both and decide later.
- Always check your spelling. If you make a spelling mistake, your answer will be marked wrong
