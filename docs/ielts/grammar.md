## If I do... and If I did

If we **go** by bus, it **will** be cheaper

**If** we **went** by bus, it **would** be cheaper

When we imagine something that will not happen, or if we dont expect that it will happen,  
then we use **if + past**  (if we went / if there was / if you found etc.)

- What would you do **if** you **won** a lot of money?  
- **If** there **was**(or *were*) an election tomorrow, who would you vote for?

**If I find vs If I found :**

- I think I left my watch at your house, **If you find** it, can you call me?
- **If you found** a wallet in the street, what would you do with it?

**if and would** won't be used together normally, but if we ask someone to do something, then we can use it. 

- I would be grateful **if** you *would let* mw know your decision as soon as possible.

**Would ('d) / Woundn't :**

- What **would** you **do** if you were bitten by a snake?
- I'm not going to bed yet. I'm not tired. If I went to bed now, I *wouldn't sleep*.
- **Would** you *mind* if I used your phone?

**Could and Might :**

- If I won a lot of money, I **might buy** a house. (= it is possible that I would buy a house)
- If it stopped raining, we **could go** out. (= we would be able to go out)

**Other Samples :**
