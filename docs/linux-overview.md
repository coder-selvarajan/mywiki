Some of the key facts about the Fedora distribution family are:

+ The Fedora family is upstream for CentOS, RHEL, and Oracle Linux.
+ Kernel version 3.10 is used in RHEL/CentOS 7.
+ It supports hardware platforms such as x86, x86-64, Itanium, PowerPC, and IBM System z.
+ It uses the RPM-based yum package manager (we cover it in more detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
+ RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.
