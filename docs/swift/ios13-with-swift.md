## Creating a Project

You can simply fill in the options as follows:

- **Product Name: HelloWorld** – This is the name of your app.
- **Team:** Just leave it as it is. You do not set the team yet. For your first app, just skip this step.
- **Organization Name: AppCoda** – It's the name of your organization. If you are not building the app for your organization, use your name as the organization name.
- **Organization Identifier: com.appcoda** – It's actually the domain name written the other way round. If you have a domain, you can use your own domain name. Otherwise, you may use "com.". For instance, your name is Pikachi. Fill in the organization identifier as "com.pikachi".
- **Bundle Identifier: com.appcoda.HelloWorld** - It's a unique identifier of your app, which is used during app submission. You do not need to fill in this option. Xcode automatically generates it for you.
- **Language: Swift** – Xcode supports both Objective-C and Swift for app development. As this book is about Swift, we'll use Swift to develop the project.
- **Use Core Data: [unchecked]** – Do not select this option. You do not need Core Data for this simple project. We'll explain Core Data in later chapters.
- **Include Unit Tests: [unchecked]** – Do not select this option. You do not need unit tests for this simple project.
- **Include UI Tests: [unchecked]** – Do not select this option. You do not need UI tests for this simple project.
