React testing by using JEst and Enzyme

`Enzyme` is develoepd by Airbnb

If we are not using create-react-app then we will have to use this command to get started with JEST.

```
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-react
npm install --save-dev enzyme
npm install --save-dev enzyme-adapter-react-16
```
